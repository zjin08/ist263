        I am Jinni Jin, and I am from Harbin,China. I like creative things, therefore, I choose advertising as my major. I gapped for two years, and I just came back to Syracuse to finish my college life. I got three different internships back in China, one at an advertising company, and other two at different internet companies. I like to watch movies, cook and eat. My favorite food is frech fries.
